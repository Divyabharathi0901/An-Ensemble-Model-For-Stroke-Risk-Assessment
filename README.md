# An-Ensemble-Model-For-Stroke-Risk-Assessment
->Stroke is the second leading cause of death. Stroke is a sudden-onset, Uncontrollable event, Stroke-related stress may impede rehabilitation and recovery. Nowadays there is an increased number of deaths which can be caused due to many reasons including stroke as one of the major reasons. As per World Health Organization (WHO) brain stroke is the second Underlying cause of death. Diagnostics and Analysis are becoming more precise as a result of technological advancements in the medical industry. If certain characteristics are properly analyzed. Stroke can be anticipated long in advance of the occurrence and lives may be spared. Ensemble techniques are compelling and powerful techniques in Machine Learning to improve the prediction accuracy as classifiers. Various machine learning techniques are used for this project. 

->The techniques are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GaussianNB, Support Vector, K-Nearest neighbour. To apply these classifiers the Stroke-Risk Assesement dataset is used and by using colab tool the performance is evaluated in the form of accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Support. The Ensemble Methods are used in this project are Voting, Bagging, Stacking, Boosting.In the proposed work, it is found that the Random forest works best with the highest accuracy of 99.2%. The accuracy of ensemble methods are 0.88%,0.98%,0.99%,0.97%.
